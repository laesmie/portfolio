              <li>Think first method is best</li>
              <li>- Think, Design, Test, Create</li>
              <li>HTML - If you've seen a picture, a button, some text, or watched a video, HTML was used to show it</li>
              <li>CSS - If you've seen pages that weren't completely black and white, CSS was used to style it</li>
              <li>JavaScript - If you've been on a website, clicked on something, and something happened (something changed), JavaScript was used</li>
              <li>All HTML code goes between the html tags</li>
              <li>All JavaScript code goes between the script tags</li>
              <li>All CSS code goes between the style tags</li>

          <ul>
            <li>When you write an application you are communicating with the user - true communication is bidirectional</li>
            <li>"Computers are stupid - Sometimes they can seem smart because they are so fast at beingn stupid"</li>
            <li>Computers can't remember anything</li>
            <li>Information stored or shared with the user is called output</li>
            <li>Anything coming in from where it was stored, or anything the user enters, is called input</li>
            <li>Input and Output is called IO - Input-Output</li>
            <li>"Placeholder" is a property specific to textarea's and input tags - used as hints for the users - tell them what they should do - will go away when they start typing</li>
            <li>h1 is the biggest header format tag - smallest is h4</li>
            <li>Section tag fills across the entire width of the screen</li>
            <li>var = variable - it is like box you can put stuff in, and it has a label - you decide the label - just make it match what it does</li>
            <li>key-value pairs = description-stuff pairs - ex: phone book: key = name, value = phone number & address</li>
          </ul>
